# Meta-TIP

This package contains the main code which is associated with the following paper:

Bowen Ma, Tong Jia, Hao Wang, and Dongyue Chen, "Meta-TIP: An Unsupervised End-to-End Fusion Network for Multi-Dataset Style-Adaptive Threat Image Projection", submitted to IEEE Transactions on Image Processing. (under review, second round)

Usage of this code is free for research purposes only.

The Meta-TIP model is learned by pytorch. This package contains our train code and pix-six train set. We will release the remaining test code and all pre-trained models if the paper is accepted.

Thank you.
